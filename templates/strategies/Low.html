    <h3>Medium-High Risk Portfolio</h3>
    <h4>Number of funds held: 7-10</h4>
    <h4>Relative Volatility: 0.5 to 0.7</h4>

<div class="strategyInfoContainer">
  <p>The Low Risk Portfolio seeks long-term growth by investing in a combination of sector funds, stock funds, and
bond funds (balanced or asset allocation funds may also be held). It aims for a neutral mix of 55% stock and
45% bond. Usually the portfolio will hold six different Fidelity Select funds, and two or three domestic funds
that hold stocks, bonds or a blend of stocks and bonds. Foreign exposure will typically range between 0-15%.
The portfolio will usually have several hundred unique underlying stock positions, and more than 1000 unique
underlying bond positions. Under certain market conditions, we may include a foreign funds.
The domestic sector portion of the portfolio attempts to invest in industry groups that are in the process of being
recognized for their long-term potential. Such sectors are identified through the study of long-term trends,
valuation levels and other fundamentals. Together, these funds account for about 200 unique stock holdings,
but there can be significant overlap between sectors. In addition, many of the sector funds are heavily
concentrated, with their top10 holdings sometimes accounting for more than 50% of assets.
When choosing diversified stock funds for this portfolio, factors we consider include historical performance,
overall volatility, stylebox position, industry sector weighting, cash level, foreign exposure, expense ratio, and
manager history.
The bond portion of the portfolio may include bond funds, conservative asset allocation funds, real estate
income funds, or capital preservation funds. Generally speaking, we strive for funds that are inversely correlated
with the stock market in order to maintain a neutral volatility level of 0.6.
Balanced or asset allocation funds may be used as a core position in this portfolio, especially if we believe that
these types of funds have the potential to deliver superior risk-adjusted returns.
The Low Risk Portfolio aims to outperform inflation. Most or all of its holdings are chosen from Fidelityâ€™s
retail mutual fund family because we believe this provides improved risk-adjusted performance relative to
competing alternatives, but it may invest in non-Fidelity funds if improved risk-adjusted performance is
believed to be available in a particular category. The portfolio typically holds actively managed funds, but
may invest in index funds during periods of heightened uncertainty. Alternative holdings (such as high-yield
bond funds, foreign bond funds, or real estate income funds) may also be held if valuations are deemed
compelling.
During bearish market conditions the portfolio may become more defensive by increasing its bond weighting,
but money market funds are not normally held.</p>
